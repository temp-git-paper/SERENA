# SERENA (Systematic Extraction and Reconstruction for Enhanced A2P Message Forensics)

ðŸ“„ Official repository for our research paper submitted to DFRWS 2025 USA

SERENA (Systematic Extraction and Reconstruction for Enhanced A2P Message Forensics) is a forensic tool designed to automate the extraction, classification, and highlighting of structured data from Application-to-Person (A2P) messages. The tool leverages GPT-4o to classify A2P messages and extract key forensic information, enabling investigators to efficiently analyze digital communications.

This repository contains:

The Python-based pipeline for processing emails, text messages, and chat logs.
The implementation of classification models using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o.
The GUI-based tool for interactive forensic analysis.

This work has been submitted to DFRWS 2025 USA and presents a novel approach to A2P message forensics.
